# HacktoberFest
It's October and that means it's time for a Data &amp; AI Hacktoberfest powered by Wortell in collaboration with Microsoft NL!

This Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. Whether youâ€™re a developer, student learning to code, experienced data scientist: you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skills levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.
